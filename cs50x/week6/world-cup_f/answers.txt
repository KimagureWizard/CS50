Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
For simulations under 100 times, the outcome may come uncompleted, as some teams with low winning chance may not be counted in.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
1000 simulations seem like the best method, as it covers all teams, and difference beteween 1000 times and above is minor.
